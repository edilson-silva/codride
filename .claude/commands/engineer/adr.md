description: Draft a new Architecture Decision Record
argument-hint: <decision to record>

# ADR

Every other command in this framework treats ADRs as load-bearing — `/engineer:discover` scans them, `adr-compliance-checker` validates code against them, `/engineer:architecture` checks alignment with them — but none of them help you *write* one. This command does.

Use it whenever a real architectural decision gets made: a technology choice, a pattern adopted (or rejected), a trade-off resolved in a specific direction. Not for implementation details that don't constrain future work.

## 1. Find the right number and check for conflicts

- List `docs/technical-context/adr/` (create it if it doesn't exist). Numbers are zero-padded and sequential (`001-`, `002-`, ...) — the new one is the next number.
- Skim existing ADRs for anything this decision touches, contradicts, or supersedes. If it does, say so explicitly and ask the human whether the old ADR should be marked **Superseded**, with a link to the new one — don't silently leave a contradiction in place.

## 2. Understand the decision

Ask the human (don't assume):
- What circumstances led to needing this decision? What's the problem it resolves?
- What did we decide, precisely?
- What alternatives were considered, and why were they not chosen?
- What are the consequences — both the benefits and the real costs/trade-offs? A decision with no downsides listed usually means they weren't looked for hard enough.
- Is this decision reversible, and how costly would reversing it be?

## 3. Write it

Save to `docs/technical-context/adr/<NNN>-<slug>.md`:

```markdown
# ADR-<NNN>: <Decision Title>

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What circumstances led to this decision?

## Decision
What did we decide?

## Rationale
Why did we choose this approach?

## Consequences
What are the positive and negative impacts? Be honest about the costs, not just the benefits.

## Alternatives Considered
What other options did we evaluate, and why weren't they chosen?
```

Keep it concrete and specific to this project — a generic ADR that could apply to any codebase isn't useful to `adr-compliance-checker` or to the next engineer reading it.

## 4. Wrap up

- If this ADR supersedes another, update the old one's `Status` to `Superseded by ADR-<NNN>` and add a note linking forward.
- Tell the human to run `/engineer:discover` to refresh `docs/technical-context/briefing/adrs-summary.md` so the new ADR is picked up by `/engineer:context`'s selective loading and by `adr-compliance-checker`.

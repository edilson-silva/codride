description: Bump the project's semver version
---

Let's prepare this for a release by bumping the version number.

Follow these rules for x.y.z (semver) versioning:

- **x (major)**: increment for incompatible API/feature changes. Examples: breaking changes to a public API (removing or renaming methods), major rewrites or refactors that change behavior, changes that require users to update their code or dependencies to stay compatible.
- **y (minor)**: increment for backwards-compatible new features or improvements. Examples: new methods, endpoints, or features; deprecating a feature (without removing it yet); improvements that don't break existing behavior.
- **z (patch)**: increment for backwards-compatible bug fixes or small updates. Examples: fixing a bug without changing intended behavior, small performance improvements, documentation/metadata updates.

Detect which package manager this project uses and bump the version accordingly:

- **Python** (`pyproject.toml` present): update the `version` field, then run `uv sync --all-extras` to regenerate the lock file (or the equivalent command for whatever tool the project actually uses — Poetry, pip-tools — if it's not `uv`).
- **Node/TypeScript** (`package.json` present): run `npm version <major|minor|patch> --no-git-tag-version` (or the equivalent `pnpm version`/`yarn version` command matching the project's package manager), which updates `package.json` and the lock file together.

If the project has both, ask the user which one to bump, or whether both should move in lockstep.

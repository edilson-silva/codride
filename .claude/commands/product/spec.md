description: Expand a validated requirement into a full PRD
argument-hint: <issue # or requirement>
---

You're acting as a product specialist helping a human take an issue's requirement to its final stage, ready for build.

If this doesn't already have a GitHub issue and refined requirement behind it, and the task is small/well-understood, `/product:quick-spec` produces the same output (FR-XX + BDD feature file) in one step — consider redirecting there instead of forcing this staged process on something that doesn't need it.

Your goal is to take an initial requirement and understand it deeply.

1. **Validate the current requirements.** Review what you were given and confirm it contains the essentials:
   - WHY we're doing this
   - WHAT is being built
   - HOW it's being built — less important than the other two, but good to have a sense of it

   If the initial requirements aren't enough to move on to a PRD, ask the user clarifying questions and update the requirement artifact/issue before proceeding. Don't assume anything — ask.

2. **Check the project's master docs** to identify any specific rule to follow, or whether this request violates a master doc. If it does, ask for clarification and only proceed if the user says to.

3. **Build your understanding of the key PRD elements:**

   - **Product overview**: problem statement and market opportunity, target users and personas, product vision and goals, success metrics and KPIs
   - **Functional requirements**: core features and capabilities, user stories or use cases, user flows and interactions, technical specs, API requirements (if applicable). Number each discrete requirement `FR-01`, `FR-02`, ... — this numbering carries through to the acceptance criteria below and to the feature file in step 6.
   - **Acceptance criteria (BDD)**: for each `FR-XX`, write the scenarios that define "done" as `Given/When/Then`:
     ```
     Given [starting state]
     When [the user does something]
     Then [expected outcome]
     ```
     Keep scenarios concrete and testable — they become the contract `/engineer:work` implements against and `/engineer:coverage` checks against. Cover the happy path plus the edge cases that actually matter (don't pad with trivial ones). Skip this for requirements too small to need it.
   - **Non-functional requirements**: performance benchmarks, security/compliance needs, scalability requirements, accessibility standards
   - **Design and UX**: UI/UX guidelines, wireframes or mockups, design-system references, platform-specific considerations
   - **Technical considerations**: architecture overview, integration requirements, data requirements, third-party dependencies
   - **Project details**: risks and mitigation strategies, release criteria and rollout plan
   - **Constraints and assumptions**: technical constraints, business constraints, key assumptions being made

   Don't overthink this. If the issue doesn't call for some of these, skip them — less is more, but don't drop important details.

4. Present your understanding to the user, along with any clarifications needed. Iterate until you have 100% clarity.

5. Once the user approves, edit the requirement artifact/issue/file, enriching it with what was discovered.

6. **Save (or update) `docs/business-context/features/<slug>.md`** — this is what makes the feature visible to `/product:sync-github`; without it, the PRD only lives on the issue and never gets tracked there. Use a kebab-case slug derived from the feature title. Format:

   ````markdown
   # [Feature Title]

   **Status**: Planned
   **Priority**: [Critical | High | Medium | Low]
   **Scope**: [MVP | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | ...]
   **Module**: [if this project groups features by module; omit otherwise]

   [1-2 paragraph product overview]

   ### FR-01: [Requirement title]
   [Description]

   **Acceptance criteria:**
   ```
   Given ...
   When ...
   Then ...
   ```

   ### FR-02: [Next requirement]
   [Same structure]
   ````

   If `docs/business-context/features/` doesn't exist yet, create it. If the file already exists (this feature was specced before), update it rather than duplicating.

The requirement to analyze is:
<requirement>
#$ARGUMENTS
</requirement>

# Project Discovery & Context Mapping

This agent analyzes the project automatically and generates a complete technical briefing in a modular format.

It is **optional** and can be run:
- Once, at the start of the project
- When ADRs change significantly
- When the codebase's architecture changes significantly — backend, frontend, or mobile

## Incremental behavior

This agent is **non-destructive**:
- If briefing files already exist: update them incrementally
- If they don't exist: create them from scratch
- Always preserve existing information

## Generated structure

```
docs/technical-context/
├── project-briefing.md              # Master index + summary
└── briefing/
    ├── critical-rules.md            # Non-negotiable rules
    ├── adrs-summary.md              # Consolidated ADRs (always created, even if empty)
    ├── backend-conventions.md       # Code conventions — only if a backend was detected
    ├── frontend-conventions.md      # Code conventions — only if a frontend was detected
    ├── mobile-conventions.md        # Code conventions — only if a mobile codebase was detected
    └── tech-stack.md                # Tech stack — one subsection per domain/service actually found
```

`backend-conventions.md`, `frontend-conventions.md`, and `mobile-conventions.md` are each
generated **only if that domain was actually detected** in this project — an empty
"no frontend found" file would be pure noise with no future value, unlike `adrs-summary.md` (which
documents "no ADRs yet" as a real, useful fact even when empty).

This conditional-generation rule applies only to *creating a new file this run*. If a prior run
already wrote one of these files and this run no longer detects that domain (e.g. a frontend was
removed from the project), leave the existing file alone per the non-destructive guarantee (Golden
Rule 2) — don't delete it automatically.

---

## Phase 1: ADR analysis (conditional)

### 1.1 Detect ADRs

```bash
paths_to_check = [
  "docs/technical-context/adr/",
  "docs/adr/",
  "adr/"
]
```

- If **none** of these paths exist: skip this phase entirely.
- If one exists: proceed with the analysis.

### 1.2 Process ADRs

For each `.md` file found in the ADR folder:

1. **Read the full file.**
2. **Extract:**
   - ADR number (e.g. ADR-001, ADR-015)
   - Title
   - Status (Accepted, Proposed, Rejected, Superseded)
   - Context/background
   - Core decision
   - Mandatory conventions (if any)
   - Consequences
   - Category (infer: database, API, code organization, security, etc.)
   - Impact (high/medium/low — infer from criticality)
3. **Identify critical rules**: look for keywords like "mandatory", "always", "never", "forbidden". Flag high-impact ADRs.

### 1.3 Consolidate ADRs

- Group by category (database, API, code organization, testing, security, etc.)
- Order by impact (high → medium → low)
- Build an index with links

### 1.4 Check existing code against the consolidated ADRs

Invoke the `adr-compliance-checker` agent against the current codebase, now that the ADRs are consolidated. This matters most when onboarding an existing project — ADRs are often written after the fact, once a convention has already drifted, so this is the first chance to see where the code and the documented decisions disagree.

If Phase 2.0 below determines this is a monorepo, don't run this as a single generic pass — invoke `adr-compliance-checker` once per workspace found in 2.0, the same way Phase 2's domain-specific analysis does, since a convention violation in `apps/api/` may not apply to `apps/web/` or `apps/mobile/` at all.

Advisory only: collect the findings for the Phase 4.2 report; don't block Phase 2-4 on them, and don't fix anything automatically.

---

## Phase 2: Codebase Domain Analysis (detection-gated)

Unlike ADR analysis (Phase 1, conditional on ADRs existing at all), this phase always runs its
detection step — but which domain-specific subsections actually execute depends entirely on what's
found. A project can be backend-only, frontend-only, mobile-only, or any combination — a Next.js
app, for instance, is legitimately both frontend and backend/API in the same codebase. Domains
aren't mutually exclusive; don't force a single classification.

### 2.0 Detect single-project vs. monorepo

Check for monorepo signals at the root: a `package.json` with a `workspaces` field, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `lerna.json`, `nx.json`, `turbo.json`, a `settings.gradle`/`settings.gradle.kts` with multiple `include(...)` modules, or multiple independent manifest files under `apps/*/` or `packages/*/` — "manifest" here means any of `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `pubspec.yaml`, `build.gradle`(.kts), `Package.swift`, `go.mod`, not just the JS-ecosystem ones.

- **If none of these exist**: single project. The "scope" for 2.0b below is the repo root.
- **If they do**: this is a monorepo. List every workspace/app/package that has its own manifest file (any of the types above) — don't just take the first match and stop. Each workspace becomes its own "scope" for 2.0b below. Keep each workspace's findings separate; don't merge them into one generic answer. A monorepo with `apps/api/`, `apps/web/`, `apps/mobile/`, and `packages/shared/` has four scopes; three of them (`apps/api/`, `apps/web/`, `apps/mobile/`) match a domain in 2.0b and get analyzed, the fourth matches none and is skipped — not one merged answer.

### 2.0b Detect which domain(s) each scope has

For each scope (the repo root in single-project mode, or each workspace in monorepo mode), check independently — a scope can match more than one domain, or none:

**Backend signals**: paths matching `apps/backend/`, `backend/`, `server/`, `api/`, `packages/backend/`, `src/backend/`, `src/` (with a server-side framework in the manifest — see 2.4), or the scope root itself when its manifest lists a server-side framework and no other backend path applies — same root-manifest fallback the frontend rule uses, for a Django/FastAPI/Rails-style repo with no dedicated backend subfolder.

**Frontend signals**: paths matching `apps/web/`, `frontend/`, `client/`, `web/`, `packages/frontend/`, or the scope root itself when its manifest lists a frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit). Checked independently of the backend signal above, not exclusively — a scope root with `api/`-style routes *and* a frontend framework in its manifest (a typical Next.js app) correctly matches both, which is exactly the non-exclusivity this phase is built around.

**Mobile signals** (check all four, but native iOS/Android are subordinate to React Native/Flutter — see the precedence note below):
- **React Native**: manifest has a `react-native` dependency (with or without `ios/`/`android/` host-project folders — Expo-managed projects have neither).
- **Flutter**: `pubspec.yaml` is present, listing `flutter` as a dependency or under `sdk:` — not just any Dart package.
- **Native iOS**: a `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` is present, with Swift/Objective-C source, **and it isn't the `ios/` host project of a scope already matched as React Native or Flutter above** — that folder is a build target of the cross-platform app, not a separate native codebase.
- **Native Android**: a `build.gradle`/`build.gradle.kts` is present, with the standard Android project structure and Kotlin/Java source, **and it isn't the `android/` host project of a scope already matched as React Native or Flutter above** — same reasoning.

A scope can still match more than one *real* combination (e.g. a standalone native Android library sitting alongside an unrelated Flutter app in a monorepo, in different scopes) — the precedence rule above only suppresses the false positive where React Native/Flutter's own host folders get double-counted as separate platforms in the *same* scope.

If a scope matches **zero** domains (e.g. a shared types/config-only package in a monorepo), skip it silently — that's expected, not an error.

If **every** scope across the whole project matches zero domains (nothing recognizable anywhere), don't silently produce empty briefings — **ask the human** where the code actually lives, per Golden Rule 1, then resume 2.0b treating whatever they point to as an additional scope before continuing to Phase 3. If only *some* scopes match nothing while at least one matches a domain, don't ask — that's the normal shared/config-only-package case — but note the count in the Phase 4.2 report (e.g. "2 of 5 scopes matched no domain") so a genuinely missed app doesn't disappear silently.

Run the domain-specific subsections below (2.1-2.4, 2.5-2.8, 2.9-2.12) only for the domains actually detected, scoped to the specific scope(s) where each was found.

### 2.1 Map the backend (for each scope where backend was detected)

Scan for:
- Controllers/routes → HTTP handlers
- Services → business logic
- Repositories/DAL → data access
- Models/entities → domain models
- Shared code (enums, types, validation schemas, utilities)
- Tests

### 2.2 Identify backend conventions

**Shared type/enum location**: find where the majority of enum/type definitions live; treat it as a convention if >80% share the same location. In monorepo mode, also check whether a `packages/shared/`-style package is where cross-service types actually live — that's itself a convention worth recording.

**Architectural patterns**: repository pattern? Service layer? MVC? — infer from which folders coexist.

**Naming**: sample 5-10 files to identify the dominant convention (kebab-case vs. camelCase vs. PascalCase, suffix conventions like `.controller.ts`/`.service.ts` or `_service.py`).

### 2.3 Detect the backend tech stack

Read the manifest file (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.) — per scope, in monorepo mode, since different services in the same monorepo commonly run different stacks:
- Web framework (Express, Fastify, NestJS, Django, FastAPI, Flask, ...)
- Database/ORM (Prisma, TypeORM, Drizzle, SQLAlchemy, Mongoose, ...)
- Validation library (Zod, Joi, Pydantic, class-validator, ...)
- Test framework (Jest, Vitest, pytest, ...)
- Runtime/language version

### 2.4 (reference) Backend frameworks that confirm a backend signal

Used by 2.0b both to confirm a backend match when the path alone is ambiguous (e.g. a bare `src/`)
and to originate a root-scope match on its own: Express, Fastify, NestJS, Django, FastAPI, Flask,
Spring, Rails, Laravel, or an ORM/DB client. Checked independently of the frontend signal, not
exclusively — same non-exclusivity principle as 2.0b's frontend rule.

---

### 2.5 Map the frontend (for each scope where frontend was detected)

Scan for:
- Component structure/organization (feature-folder, atomic design, flat, etc.)
- Hooks/composables
- State management (Redux, Zustand, Pinia, Vuex, Context API, Signals, ...)
- Routing
- Styling approach (CSS modules, Tailwind, styled-components, vanilla CSS, ...)
- API-client layer — how the frontend talks to a backend, if any (fetch wrapper, generated client, GraphQL client, ...)
- Tests

### 2.6 Identify frontend conventions

**Naming**: sample 5-10 files to identify the dominant convention (kebab-case vs. camelCase vs. PascalCase, suffix conventions like `.component.tsx`, `.hook.ts`).

**Architectural patterns**: feature-folder vs. type-folder organization, atomic design, container/presentational split — infer from which folders coexist, same technique as 2.2.

### 2.7 Detect the frontend tech stack

Read the manifest file, per scope in monorepo mode:
- Framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, ...)
- State management library
- Styling approach/library
- Build tool (Vite, Webpack, Turbopack, ...)
- Test framework (Vitest, Jest, Testing Library, Playwright/Cypress for e2e, ...)
- Runtime/language version

### 2.8 (reference) Frontend frameworks that confirm a frontend signal

Used by 2.0b: React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit. Checked independently of
the backend signal, not exclusively — same non-exclusivity principle as
2.0b's frontend rule.

---

### 2.9 Map each detected mobile platform (React Native, Flutter, native iOS, native Android)

For each platform actually detected in 2.0b, scan for:
- Screens/views organization
- Navigation pattern (stack/tab/drawer — whichever navigation library or native pattern is in use)
- State management
- Native module / platform-channel usage (React Native and Flutter only — where platform-specific code is bridged)
- Architectural pattern (MVVM, MVC, MVI — infer from which folders/files coexist, same technique as 2.2)

If a scope matches more than one mobile platform (e.g. a native Android library alongside a
Flutter app in the same monorepo), map each platform separately — don't merge them.

### 2.10 Identify mobile conventions (per platform)

**Naming**: sample 5-10 files per platform to identify the dominant convention.

**Screen/navigation organization**: how screens are grouped (by feature, by flow, flat) and how navigation is wired (declarative route table, programmatic, native storyboard/nav-graph).

### 2.11 Detect the mobile tech stack (per platform)

- React Native / Flutter version, or native SDK/minimum-OS-version target
- Key libraries (navigation library, state management library, native-module bridges)
- Test framework (if any)

### 2.12 (reference) Mobile detection signals

Used by 2.0b — repeated here for completeness, including the precedence rule (native iOS/Android
don't separately match inside a scope already identified as React Native or Flutter):
- React Native: `react-native` in the manifest (host `ios/`/`android/` folders optional — Expo-managed projects have neither).
- Flutter: `pubspec.yaml` listing `flutter` as a dependency or under `sdk:`.
- Native iOS: `.xcodeproj`/`.xcworkspace` present, Swift/Objective-C source, not a React Native/Flutter host project.
- Native Android: `build.gradle`(.kts) present with standard Android structure, Kotlin/Java source, not a React Native/Flutter host project.

## Phase 3: Generate the briefing files

### 3.1 Create the folder if it doesn't exist

```bash
mkdir -p docs/technical-context/briefing/
```

### 3.2 `project-briefing.md` (master index)

Include: an executive-summary project status, an index of the briefing files **actually generated
this run** (not a fixed list — see 3.5-3.8 below), a usage guide by feature type, and maintenance
instructions. Target size: ~150 lines.

### 3.3 `briefing/critical-rules.md`

The 3-5 most critical rules from the ADRs, mandatory conventions, and a compliance checklist. **This file gets copied in full into every `context.md`.** Target size: ~80 lines.

### 3.4 `briefing/adrs-summary.md`

If ADRs exist: an index by category, each ADR summarized with title, status, impact, decision, mandatory conventions, and a link to the full ADR. If no ADRs exist: create the file anyway with a note that none are defined yet. Target size: scales with ADR count.

### 3.5 `briefing/backend-conventions.md` (only if backend was detected — see 2.0b)

Folder structure (ASCII tree), file/class/method naming, code patterns (controller/service/repository or equivalent), and a couple of representative code examples. In monorepo mode, use one subsection per service instead of collapsing them into a single generic answer — a convention that holds in `apps/api/` may not hold elsewhere. Target size: ~150 lines (scales with the number of services). Skip this file entirely if no backend was detected anywhere in the project.

### 3.6 `briefing/frontend-conventions.md` (only if frontend was detected — see 2.0b)

Folder/component structure (ASCII tree), naming, state management approach, styling approach, and a couple of representative code examples. In monorepo mode, one subsection per frontend workspace. Target size: ~150 lines. Skip this file entirely if no frontend was detected anywhere in the project.

### 3.7 `briefing/mobile-conventions.md` (only if any mobile platform was detected — see 2.0b)

One subsection per platform detected (React Native, Flutter, native iOS, native Android), and — same as 3.5/3.6 — one subsection per scope within a platform if more than one scope matches it (e.g. two separate Flutter apps in a monorepo don't collapse into one subsection): screen/navigation organization, naming, architectural pattern, and a couple of representative code examples per platform/scope. Target size: ~150 lines (scales with the number of platforms and scopes). Skip this file entirely if no mobile codebase was detected anywhere in the project.

### 3.8 `briefing/tech-stack.md`

One subsection per domain actually found (backend/frontend/mobile), and within a domain, one subsection per service/workspace/platform if more than one was found for that domain (same pattern already used for monorepo backend services, extended to also mean "per domain"). Include a line noting which package manager/workspace tool ties a monorepo together (pnpm workspaces, Nx, Turborepo, Lerna), if applicable. Target size: ~100-150 lines (scales with the number of domains/services/platforms).

---

## Phase 4: Validation and wrap-up

### 4.1 Sanity check

- All files created successfully?
- Do cross-links between files resolve?
- No unexpectedly empty file?
- No domain-conventions file newly created for a domain that wasn't actually detected this run (3.5-3.7 are conditional — double-check none were created "just in case"; this doesn't apply to a file that already existed from a prior run, which is left untouched per the non-destructive guarantee)?

### 4.2 Report to the human

Build this report dynamically — the file list and the summary lines each reflect only what was
actually found and generated this run. Example shape (a real report omits any line for a domain
that wasn't detected):

```
✅ Project Discovery complete.

📁 Files generated:
- docs/technical-context/project-briefing.md (master index)
- docs/technical-context/briefing/critical-rules.md
- docs/technical-context/briefing/adrs-summary.md
- docs/technical-context/briefing/backend-conventions.md   [only if backend was detected]

📊 Summary:
- ADRs analyzed: X
- Critical rules: X
- Backend framework(s): [name, or one per service — omit this line if no backend was found]
- Frontend framework(s): [name, or one per workspace — omit this line if no frontend was found]
- Mobile platform(s): [e.g. "React Native", "Flutter + native Android" — omit this line if no mobile codebase was found]
- Database/ORM: [name, if a backend was found]
- ADR compliance (adr-compliance-checker): [no ADRs to check / N violations found, listed below / clean — one line per scope in monorepo mode]
- Scopes with no domain match: [N of M — omit this line if 0, expected for shared/config-only packages]

[If violations were found, list each: which ADR, where in the code, and the suggested fix.]

💡 Next steps:
1. Review project-briefing.md for accuracy.
2. Review critical-rules.md (it gets copied into every context.md).
3. Run engineer-context when ready to start a feature.

ℹ️  This briefing is loaded automatically by engineer-context to enrich context.
🔄 To update it, run engineer-discover again (incremental, non-destructive).
```

⛔ **After reporting to the human, STOP. Don't automatically proceed to `engineer-context` or any other agent. Wait for feedback.**

---

## What this needs to do

- Search the project for files: ADRs, manifest files, source files.
- Read file contents.
- Create/update the briefing files.

---

## Error handling

- **Malformed ADR**: warn the human ("ADR X is malformed, skipping"), continue with the others, and list what was skipped at the end.
- **Unrecognized structure for a detected domain**: if a scope clearly matches a domain (backend/frontend/mobile) but its internal structure can't be mapped confidently (2.1/2.5/2.9), ask the human where the relevant folders/files live instead of guessing — same treatment for all three domains, not backend-only.
- **No manifest file found**: warn that analysis will be limited and document what could be inferred from the folder structure alone.

---

## Verbose mode (optional)

If the user asks for detailed/verbose progress, show it in full: each ADR processed, each scope's domain detection, each file scanned, each generated file. Otherwise, default to a summarized progress report with only warnings/errors shown.

---

## Golden rules

1. **Never assume** — if something can't be found, ask the human. If every scope in the project matches zero domains (2.0b), don't silently generate empty briefings — ask where the code lives.
2. **Be incremental** — don't overwrite existing information without reason.
3. **Be explicit** — cross-links between files must resolve.
4. **Be resilient** — an error in one phase shouldn't stop the whole process.
